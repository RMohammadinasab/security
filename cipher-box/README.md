# Cryptographic Algorithms Collection

This repository provides a collection of cryptographic algorithms, each implemented as an independent tool for better accessibility and usability. Each tool supports both encoding and decoding functionalities.

## Available Algorithms
- **Caesar Cipher**
- **Morse Code**
- **Hashing Algorithms**
- **Transposition Cipher**
- **Vernam Cipher**
- **Multiplicative Inverse Cipher**
- **DES**
- **AES (Multiple Modes)**
- **Salsa20**
- **ChaCha20**
- **Vigenère Cipher**

## Repository Structure
Each algorithm is maintained as a separate project to allow users to easily integrate and use specific encryption or decryption techniques as needed. Each tool includes:
- Implementation in Python
- Detailed usage instructions
- Examples for encoding and decoding

## How to Use
To use any of the cryptographic tools, navigate to the respective algorithm’s directory and follow the provided instructions in the `README.md` file within that directory.

## Contribution
Contributions are welcome. If you would like to enhance an existing tool or add a new cryptographic method, please submit a pull request with clear documentation and examples.
