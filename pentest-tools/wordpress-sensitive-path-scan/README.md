# Sensitive paths Scan Tool

## Introduction
This tool is designed to test the security of a web application by sending HTTP requests to various sensitive paths using different methods and user agents. It logs the responses to help identify potential security risks.

## Features
- Supports multiple HTTP methods: `GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `TRACE`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`
- Uses various User-Agent headers to bypass Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)
- Reads sensitive paths from a text file and tests access to them
- Logs all requests and responses in a timestamped log file
- Handles request exceptions and logs errors

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.6 or later).

### Install Required Dependencies
```sh
pip install requests
```

## Usage
### Running the Script
Execute the script using the following command:
```sh
python script.py
```

### Input Parameters
1. The script prompts for the target domain (e.g., `https://example.com`).
2. It also asks for the path to a text file containing sensitive paths to test.

### Example of a Sensitive Paths File
Create a file named `paths.txt` with the following content:
```
admin
login
config.php
wp-admin
robots.txt
```

### Example Run
```sh
Enter the target domain (e.g., https://example.com): https://target-site.com
Enter the path to the text file containing sensitive paths: paths.txt
```

## Output
- The script generates a log file in the current directory named with the timestamp (e.g., `scan_log_2025-03-16_14-30-00.txt`).
- Each log entry contains the HTTP method, URL, response status, response message, and the User-Agent used.

## Example Log Output
```
14:30:00 | GET https://target-site.com/admin | 403 Forbidden | Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) Chrome/98.0.4758.102 Safari/537.36
14:30:02 | HEAD https://target-site.com/login | 200 OK | Googlebot/2.1 (+http://www.google.com/bot.html)
ERROR: TRACE https://target-site.com/config.php | Connection timed out
```

## Notes
- Ensure you have permission to scan the target website.
- Scanning without authorization may be illegal and against terms of service.
