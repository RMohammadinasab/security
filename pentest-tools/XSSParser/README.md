# XSSParser - Automated XSS Scanner

## Introduction
XSSParser is a penetration testing tool designed to detect **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities** in websites. It automatically tests a list of payloads on a given parameter and analyzes the server's response.

## Features
- Supports **GET** and **POST** methods
- Reads payloads from a text file
- Includes a timeout feature to prevent request hangs
- Saves results in a log file (`xss_log.txt`)
- Displays **Response Code and Headers**
- Detects **Reflected XSS** by analyzing server responses

## Installation & Usage
### 1. Install Dependencies
Before running the tool, install the required Python library:

```bash
pip install requests
```

### 2. Run the Tool
Execute the script using Python:

```bash
python3 XSSParser.py
```

### 3. Required Inputs
The tool will prompt for the following inputs:
- **Target URL** → The website URL to test
- **Parameter** → The input parameter to test (e.g., `q`, `search`)
- **Payload File** → Path to a text file containing XSS payloads
- **Request Method** → Choose **GET** or **POST**

## Example Usage
Suppose you want to test `example.com`, you have a file `payloads.txt`, and you choose the **GET** method:

```bash
python3 XSSParser.py
```

Then enter the following inputs:

```
Please enter the target URL: https://example.com/search
Input parameter (for example: s): q
Enter your payloads file path: payloads.txt
Method (GET/POST): GET
```

### Example Output
```bash
Testing with: <script>alert('XSS')</script>
URL: https://example.com/search?q=<script>alert('XSS')</script>
Response Code: 200
Headers:
{'Content-Type': 'text/html; charset=UTF-8', 'Server': 'nginx'}
============================================================
XSS vulnerability detected! (Payload: <script>alert('XSS')</script>)
