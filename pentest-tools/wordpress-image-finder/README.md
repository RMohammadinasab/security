# WordPress Image Finder

## About
A tool to find images in a WordPress site using different methods. This Python tool helps users find images stored in a WordPress site's upload directory. It supports multiple methods to retrieve images, making it useful for security testing, backup recovery, and web scraping.

## Features
- **Directory Listing Check** - Detects if directory listing is enabled and lists available images.
- **WordPress API Check** - Uses the `wp-json/wp/v2/media` API to fetch uploaded media files.
- **Brute Force Detection** - Attempts to find images by guessing common filenames.
- **User-Selectable Methods** - Allows users to choose a specific method or run all methods together.
- **Easy-to-Use** - Simple command-line interface for quick execution.

## Installation
This tool requires Python 3 and a few dependencies. Install them using:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

## How to Use
Run the script and enter a WordPress site URL when prompted:

```bash
python wordpress_image_finder.py
```

Then, choose a method to find images:

```bash
Select a method to find images:

1: Directory Listing - Checks if the website allows listing all files in the upload folder.
2: WordPress API - Uses the built-in API to list uploaded media files.
3: Brute Force - Tries to guess image filenames by checking common patterns.
4: Run all methods
```

Enter the desired option (1, 2, 3, or 4), and the tool will attempt to retrieve images.

## How It Works
### 1. Directory Listing
Some WordPress sites allow directory listing, which exposes all files in `/wp-content/uploads/`. This tool checks for this vulnerability and extracts image URLs.

### 2. WordPress API
WordPress provides an API endpoint (`/wp-json/wp/v2/media`) that lists uploaded media files. If enabled, this method retrieves all stored images from the API.

### 3. Brute Force
If directory listing and API access are blocked, brute force is used. The script tries common filenames like `image1.jpg`, `image2.png`, etc., and checks if they exist.
