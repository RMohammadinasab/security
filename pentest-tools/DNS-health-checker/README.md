# üõ°Ô∏è DNS Health Checker Tool

A Python-based tool to assess the security and health of DNS configurations. This utility helps identify potential DNS vulnerabilities including:

- Zone Transfer vulnerability
- DNS Cache Snooping
- DNS Cache Poisoning
- Reverse DNS Lookup

---

##  Features

 **Zone Transfer Check**  
Detects if a DNS server allows unauthorized zone transfers, which can expose domain records.

 **DNS Cache Snooping Detection**  
Identifies whether specific DNS resolvers leak cached query results, potentially revealing browsing history.

 **DNS Cache Poisoning Detection**  
Checks for discrepancies in DNS responses from multiple servers to detect signs of poisoning attacks.

 **Reverse DNS Lookup**  
Retrieves domain names from an IP address via PTR queries.

 **Result Logging**  
All results are saved in a file named `dns_scan_results.txt` for future reference.

---

##  Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [`dnspython`](https://www.dnspython.org/) library

### Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install dnspython

```

## Input Requirements

You must provide a plain text file containing a list of domains or subdomains (one per line). For example:

subs.txt

```bash
example.com
test.example.org
mysite.net
```

## How to Use
Run the script:

```bash
python dns_health_check.py

```

You'll be prompted to enter the path to your input file:

```bash
Enter the path to the subdomains file (e.g. subs.txt):
```

After scanning, results will be saved in:

```bash
dns_scan_results.txt
```

## Example Output

Here's a simplified version of the generated output in dns_scan_results.txt:

```bash
Results for example.com:
Zone Transfer successful on 192.0.2.1!
Reverse DNS Lookup Result for 8.8.8.8: dns.google
Cache Snooping detected:
8.8.8.8: {'answers': [('example.com. 300 IN A 93.184.216.34', 300)], 'headers': 256, ...}
1.1.1.1: {'answers': [('example.com. 300 IN A 93.184.216.34', 300)], ...}
Cache Poisoning Check: No DNS Cache Poisoning detected.
Request Logs:
8.8.8.8: {'headers': 256, 'response_packet': 'id 12345\ntc rd ra ...'}
...
```

## Output

    A file named dns_scan_results.txt will be created with detailed results of each test.

    Results include:

        Zone Transfer status

        Reverse DNS result

        Cache Snooping and DNS headers

        DNS Poisoning indicators and response logs

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

    Make sure you have network access and DNS ports (UDP 53) are not blocked by a firewall.

    This tool is for educational and security auditing purposes only. Do not use it on networks or domains you do not own or have permission to test.
