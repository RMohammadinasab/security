# Network Scanner Tool

## Overview
This tool is an Network Scanner Tool based on Nmap that allows users to detect live hosts, open ports, and running services. The scanner provides flexibility in input methods, supports evasion techniques to bypass WAF detection, and logs the scan results.

## Features
- **Three input methods:**
  - Single IP address scan
  - Subnet scan (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`)
  - Multiple IPs/Subnets from a file (`ips.txt`)
- **Full port scan (`-p0-`)**
- **Advanced scanning options (`-A` for OS detection, service detection, and script scanning)**
- **High-speed scan optimization (`-T4`)**
- **Evasion techniques:**
  - Randomized host selection (`--randomize-hosts`)
  - Data length obfuscation (`--data-length 50`)
  - MAC address spoofing (`--spoof-mac 0`)
- **Logs all scan results into `scan_results.log`**

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Nmap installed on your system. If Nmap is not installed, use the following command:

#### Linux:
```bash
sudo apt install nmap
```

#### macOS:
```bash
brew install nmap
```

#### Windows:
Download and install Nmap from [nmap.org](https://nmap.org/download.html).

You also need the `python-nmap` library:
```bash
pip install python-nmap
```

## Usage
Run the script with:
```bash
python port-scaneer.py
```
Then, select the input method:
```
Select input method:
1 - Enter a single IP address
2 - Enter a subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)
3 - Read from a file (ips.txt)
```

### Example Scans
#### 1️⃣ Single IP Address:
```
Enter the IP address: 192.168.1.10
```
#### 2️⃣ Subnet Scan:
```
Enter the subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24): 192.168.1.0/24
```
#### 3️⃣ Multiple IPs/Subnets from a File:
Ensure `ips.txt` contains:
```
192.168.1.10
192.168.1.0/24
```
The script will automatically extract and scan all IPs.

## Output
Results will be displayed in the console and saved to `scan_results.log` with details of live hosts, open ports, and running services.

## Example Output

```bash
Scanning 192.168.1.1 ...
Scanning 192.168.1.2 ...
Live Hosts:
==================================================
192.168.1.1 is UP:
  Port 22: ssh
  Port 80: http
--------------------------------------------------
192.168.1.5 is UP:
  Port 3306: mysql
--------------------------------------------------
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Nmap (`sudo apt install nmap` on Linux)
- Internet connection (for external scans)
