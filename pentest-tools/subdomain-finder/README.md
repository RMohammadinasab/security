# Subdomain Finder Tool

## About
This is a simple Python tool that uses dnsrecon to perform brute-force subdomain enumeration on a given domain using a custom wordlist.
Features

## Features
- Performs brute-force subdomain enumeration using dnsrecon
- Allows specifying a custom wordlist
- Automatically saves results to a file (subdomains.txt)
- Easy to run with a single input prompt

## Requirements

Before using this tool, make sure the following are installed:

  - Python 3.x

  - dnsrecon

You can install dnsrecon via pip:

```bash
pip install dnsrecon
```

Or clone it manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/darkoperator/dnsrecon.git
cd dnsrecon
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

## Installation

    Clone this repository or download the script.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/subdomain-finder.git
cd subdomain-finder
```

    Make sure the subdomains-top1million.txt wordlist exists in the same directory as the script. You can use any custom wordlist.

    (Optional) Create a virtual environment and activate it:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

## Usage

To run the tool:

```bash
python subdomain_finder.py
```

Then, when prompted:
```bash
Please enter the target domain (e.g., example.com):
```

Enter the domain you want to enumerate subdomains for.

After completion, results will be saved to:

```bash
subdomains.txt
```

## Example Output
```bash
Please enter the target domain (e.g., example.com): example.com

Found subdomains (results saved in subdomains.txt):
 - www.example.com
 - mail.example.com
 - dev.example.com
```

## Notes

 - The script uses dnsrecon in brute-force mode (-t brt)

 - Default wordlist: subdomains-top1million.txt

 - Output file: subdomains.txt

 - You can modify the script to change the wordlist or output file name
